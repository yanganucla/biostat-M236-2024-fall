Figure 1: Profile plots of GCC thickness over time for individual participants. 
The plots show a general trend of decreasing GCC thickness over the 4-year study period. While most participants exhibit gradual declines, some trajectories suggest significant variability, with a few individuals showing relatively stable or even increasing GCC thickness. This variability highlights potential differences in disease progression rates among participants.

Figure 2: Empirical summary plot of GCC measurements over rounded time points. The plot illustrates the mean GCC thickness (microns) at each time point, with error bars indicating variability across participants. The blue line connects mean GCC values over time, showing an overall declining trend. The wide variability at some time points reflects differences in individual trajectories.

Figure 3: Profile plot of empirical within-subject residuals over rounded time points. The residuals represent deviations of observed GCC thickness from the fitted model predictions. While most residuals cluster around zero, individual trajectories show substantial variability, indicating potential model misfit or individual-specific factors affecting GCC thickness that are not accounted for by the model.

```
table2:The Durbin-Watson test identified significant positive autocorrelation in the residuals (DW=1.5821,p<0.001), suggesting that the model assumptions of independent residuals are violated. This finding indicates the need for adjustments to the model structure, such as incorporating temporal correlation or random slopes, to account for the observed autocorrelation. Therefore, we will add a random slope random effect and use a model with an AR(1) (autoregressive) correlation structure.

Figure 4: GCC thickness over time for each subject after removing outliers. The plot shows the individual trajectories of GCC thickness over the 4-year study period. Outlier removal reduces extreme variability, resulting in more consistent patterns across participants. The overall trend of declining GCC thickness remains apparent.

Figure 5: Empirical summary plot of GCC measurements over rounded time points after removing outliers. The plot displays the mean GCC thickness (microns) at each time point, with error bars reflecting variability across participants. The blue line connects the mean values, illustrating a smoother trend compared to the plot with outliers included. The reduced variability demonstrates the impact of outlier removal on the overall data structure.

Figure 6: Profile plot of empirical within-subject residuals over time (outliers removed). The residuals, representing deviations of observed GCC thickness from model predictions, are plotted for each subject. The removal of outliers reduces extreme residuals, resulting in a more consistent pattern around zero. This suggests an improvement in the model fit and greater alignment between observed and predicted values.

lm_model <- lm(GCC ~ time_rounded, data = final_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(lm_model)

```
Table 1: A basic linear model was fit to evaluate the population-level association between GCC thickness and time. The model estimated an average baseline GCC thickness of 83.47 microns, with a significant annual decline of 0.60 microns per year (β = -0.60, p = 0.014). However, the model accounted for only 0.79% of the variance (R² = 0.0079), suggesting that time alone explains a minimal proportion of the variability in GCC thickness. These results highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques to incorporate individual variability and non-linear patterns in GCC thickness changes over time.

Figure 7: Improved scatterplot matrix of GCC measurements. The plot shows the relationships between time and GCC thickness, along with the marginal distributions for each variable. The scatterplot and correlation coefficient (r=−0.097,p<0.01) reveal a weak negative association between GCC thickness and time, indicating a gradual decline in GCC over the study period.

#####table5population average rate of decline and range of individual rates of decline


the results indicate the following:

Population Average Rate of GCC Decline:

The population-level average decline in GCC thickness is -0.6039 microns per year. This represents the fixed effect of time from the mixed model.
Range of Individual Rates of Decline:

The range of individual-specific rates of GCC decline, derived by incorporating random effects, is:
Minimum rate: -3.31 microns/year (faster decline).
Maximum rate: 1.17 microns/year (slower or even positive trend).
The histogram of individual rates of GCC decline (random slopes for time) highlights variability across individuals. Some patients experience faster declines, while others might even show slight improvements in GCC thickness over time.

Use an ANCOVA to assess whether baseline GCC thickness affects the rate of decline:
𝐻0 No interaction between baseline GCC group and time.
𝐻𝑎: Interaction between baseline GCC group and time.
A significant interaction  was observed between baseline GCC group and time, indicating faster declines in the high baseline group compared to medium and low groups.

Figure 9: GCC Decline Over Time by Baseline GCC Group
Description for Appendix (Above Figure)
Figure 9: This plot illustrates the decline in GCC thickness over four years for patients categorized by their baseline GCC thickness (Low, Medium, and High). Each colored line represents individual trajectories within a group, and the shaded region represents the confidence intervals around group-level trends.

Visualization Findings:

The plot shows the GCC thickness trends over time for three baseline GCC groups: "Low," "Medium," and "High."
The slopes for GCC decline appear similar across the groups, and the confidence intervals overlap significantly, suggesting no substantial difference in decline rates.
Statistical Model Results:

The mixed-effects model (GCC ~ time * baseline_GCC + (1 + time | id)) did not show a significant interaction between time and baseline GCC, indicating that the baseline GCC does not significantly affect the rate of GCC decline.
The fixed effect of time indicates an average annual decline of approximately -0.60 microns, consistent across the groups.
Conclusion:

Based on both statistical modeling and the visualization, the hypothesis that patients with higher baseline GCC experience faster GCC decline is not supported by this dataset.

"GCC: ganglion cell complex; regression line shows population average decline."

Figure 11: Random Effects Model for GCC Decline

Demonstrates the variation in GCC thickness trends across individuals. The random slopes and intercepts indicate substantial between-subject differences.

"Individual-level random effects model showcasing the heterogeneity in GCC decline trajectories."
"Each line represents a participant's GCC trend; the shaded area shows confidence intervals."

Figure 12: GCC Thickness vs. Baseline Age

Shows no significant association between baseline age and GCC thickness.

"Baseline age does not significantly predict GCC thickness."
"GCC: ganglion cell complex; age effect minimal (see regression line)."

Figure 13: GCC Decline Over Time by Age Group

The grouped data indicates no noticeable interaction between age group and GCC decline.
"GCC decline trends remain consistent across age groups."
"No significant group interaction detected for age and GCC trajectories."

Table 3
Comparison of random-effects models with and without age adjustment. Results indicate that adding age as a covariate does not significantly improve model fit (p=0.7557).
